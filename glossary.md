## Articulations, ornamentations & embellishments

<dl>
  <dt>Glissando</dt><dd>sliding the finger up or down from one note to another (in string players). Often abbreviated “gliss.” (In piano, the player would run their finger along the notes, hitting all the white keys.)</dd>
  <dt>Grace note</dt><dd>ornamentation used to decorate or embellish a melody. A note printed in small type to indicate that its time value is not counted in the rhythm of the bar and must be subtracted from that of an adjacent note (typically played before the beat it is attached to)</dd>
  <dt>Harmonic</dt><dd>a single partial in the overtone series. On a string instrument, it refers to playing a note where you only partially dampen the string, creating a partial node, so that the note rings much higher up in the overtone series.</dd>
  <dt>Legato</dt><dd>Indication to play notes smooth and connected. (as opposed to detached; almost opposite to staccato)</dd>
  <dt>Portato</dt><dd>denotes a smooth, pulsing articulation and is often notated by adding dots or lines under slur markings</dd>
  <dt>Ricochet</dt><dd>a bowing technique where you drop/throw the bow at the string in such a way that it bounces on it’s own</dd>
  <dt>Spiccato</dt><dd>a bow articulation in which notes are to be played in the middle of the bow, bouncing the bow naturally off the string.</dd>
  <dt>Staccato</dt><dd>A style of playing notes in a detached (often times short), separated, distinct manner. (almost opposite to legato)</dd>
  <dt>Tremolo</dt><dd>a technique where you rapidly move the bow back and forth on a single note very very fast; tremolo is a quick unmetered repetition</dd>
  <dt>Trill</dt><dd>an ornament consisting of the more or less rapid alternation of a note and the one above the note</dd>
  <dt>Turn</dt><dd>an ornament that “turns around” the main note, in which you play the note, play the note above, play the main note, play the note below, play the main note.</dd>
  <dt>Vibrato</dt><dd>a pulsing in pitch of a note, almost like a “warble” sound. In string players it is produced by rocking the finger back and forth quickly, so that the note “vibrates”</dd>

  <dt>Ritardando</dt><dd>(It.) indication to gradually slow down the tempo. Often abbreviated “rit.” or “ritard.”</dd>

  <dt>Arpeggio</dt><dd>to play the notes of a chord consecutively (either going up in pitch or down)</dd>

  <dt>Diatonic</dt><dd>all the notes that are naturally occuring in the established key (via the key signature). For example, if you’re looking at a piano keyboard, and you are in the key of C major, it’s all the white keys (all the black keys are non-diatonic)</dd>

  <dt>Syncopation</dt><dd>Deliberate upsetting of the meter or pulse of a composition by means of a temporary shifting of the accent to a weak beat or an off-beat.</dd>

## Compositional structure
<dl>
  <dt>Cadence</dt><dd>the manner in which a section or passage concludes, including the notes leading up to the final note, as well as the method of harmonic progression of the chords leading to the end.</dd>
  <dt>Cadenza</dt><dd>An ornamental passage performed near the close of a composition, usually improvised, in a way that shows off the performer’s virtuosity and technique, and usually performed by a soloist, usually without orchestral accompaniment.</dd>
  <dt>Coda</dt><dd>the closing few measures of a composition, usually not part of any of the main theme groups. A “tag” at the end of a piece, often times playful or light in nature.</dd>
  <dt>Counterpoint</dt><dd>The art of combining two or more melodies to be performed simultaneously and musically. In counterpoint, the melody is supported by another melody rather than by chords.</dd>
  <dt>Elegy</dt><dd>A sorrowful or melancholy poem or musical work, mourning for someone dead, often characterized by a slow descending melodic line in a minor key. (Other musical words for mourning pieces include: lament, planctus, tombeau, apotheose, lacryme)</dd>
  <dt>Leitmotif</dt><dd>A recurring motif or theme in a composition which represents a specific person, idea, or emotion. This specific term (leitmotif) was first applied to the operas of Richard Wagner. However, the concept of assigning a theme/motif to a person or idea dates back much earlier to other compositions/composers.</dd>
  <dt>Lied / Lieder</dt><dd>a type of German song, especially of the romantic period, typically for solo voice with piano accompaniment.</dd>
  <dt>Rhapsody / Rapsodie</dt><dd>A rhapsody is a free composition. The term was first used for piano compositions in 1810. It may be defined as a free fantasia of national, epic, or heroic character.</dd>
  <dt>Rondo</dt><dd>Term referring to a form of composition in which the first section recurs after the second section is performed in an A-B-A style. Also, a rondo could have more sections arranged: A-B-A-B-A, or A-B-A-C-A, etc. This form is found especially in compositions of the Baroque and Classical eras.</dd>
  <dt>“Style Galant”</dt><dd>This style became popular in the Classical Period. It is a clear, elegant, uncomplicated style that arose in contrast to the more complex style of Baroque counterpoint. It is light, graceful, sometimes witty, and very pleasing to listen to.</dd>
  <dt>Ternary Form</dt><dd>A compositional form which consists of three major sections, an A section which states the thematic material, a B section which presents a contrasting theme, and a final A section which restates the opening thematic material.</dd>
